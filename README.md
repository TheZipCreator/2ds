# 2ds
 Implementation of the 2DS esolang.

# Requirements
 Some form of conio.h, if you're on Windows this will be there by default, and on linux just get it from [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3276546/how-to-implement-getch-function-of-c-in-linux)

# Compiling
 Do `gcc 2ds.c -o 2ds` to compile it with GCC, which is pre-installed on pretty much every linux distro.
